Steps to run locally on your System:-
1.Use this command to install all the required libraries in your environment
  pip install -r requirements.txt
2.Change the path to your video.
3.You can also change the weights given to the model for the estimation if you created .pt file by training the model on a specific usecase(by default it is set on yolov8n.pt)
4.Run the main.py file 
It will generate a distance calculation video which marks under 30m person from the centroid as threat.
