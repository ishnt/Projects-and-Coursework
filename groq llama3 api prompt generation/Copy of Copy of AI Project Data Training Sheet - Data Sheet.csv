So we both were able to add and help each other along the goals setting process And we were holding each other accountable.

You wanna hire a sales person because although you're gonna have to pay them 10% of your sales, it's gonna get you back six to eight hours a day to get more appointments on your calendar to then hire more sales people to be able to scale.
And the third person should be a video editor. Now, if you're not creating videos, you definitely need to in today's day and age. It's how you can build trust with your prospects before they even get on a call with you to begin with. And so, editing videos is a pretty difficult thing to do.

And here's exactly how I'm able to do this.""","""The first thing is the night before. You want to write out everything you have to get done the next day very clearly on an iPad or on pen and paper.

Not to mention, I had to keep hiring people in order to fulfill for my clients. And then after they left, I was stuck with all this overhead and it left us unprofitable.

You need a proven system inside your business that generates you new leads every single day.""","""And in this quick video, I'm gonna show you exactly how, so drop me a follow down below.

That means instead of cold prospecting or praying that you'll go viral, you need to start attracting prospects to your personal brand by running profile visit ads, just like this one, that bring in anywhere from 20 to 150 real engaged followers every single day.

So instead of relying on other team members and outdated systems, you need a predictable acquisition system that's going to get you direct results. Number two, you need to take your cold following and turn it into warm prospects who know like and trust you by posting Instagram and YouTube content.
